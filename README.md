## Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio 

## üìåAbout Me

I am Gopal Dhanokar, an Embedded Systems trainee with strong programming skills in C, C++, Embedded C, and Data Structures. Currently training at Vector India, Hyderabad, I‚Äôm working extensively with microcontrollers like ARM7 (LPC2129/LPC2148), 8051, and AVR (ATmega328P), and gaining in-depth knowledge of embedded hardware and software integration.

My focus areas include real-time operating systems (RTOS), Linux-based development, and communication protocols such as CAN, SPI, I2C, and UART. I enjoy problem-solving and continuously seek to improve system efficiency and reliability. My dedication to learning and building practical solutions is driven by a passion for coding, electronics, and system interfacing.

I‚Äôm looking forward to contributing to innovative embedded technology projects and growing in a challenging, fast-paced environment that values creativity and technical depth.

__üó≥Ô∏è 2. SMART ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINE__

__Objective:__Designed and implemented an electronic voting machine to replace traditional manual systems, ensuring secure, transparent, and efficient voting. The system uses an Arduino UNO as the central controller, allowing voters to select candidates via push buttons, with votes counted and displayed in real-time on a 16x2 LCD. A dedicated "result" button provides instant tally results, eliminating fraud and enhancing user experience.

__Learning Keys:__
 - Understood real-time embedded system design using Arduino UNO as the core controller.
 - Gained experience in push button interfacing and vote logic implementation.
 - Learned how to display dynamic data using a 16x2 LCD for live vote count and result display.
 - Implemented a fraud-proof voting mechanism with secure input handling and instant result generation.
 - Strengthened skills in Embedded C programming, hardware debugging, and user-centric design.
