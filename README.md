## Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio 

## üìåAbout Me

I am Gopal Dhanokar, an Embedded Systems trainee with strong programming skills in C, C++, Embedded C, and Data Structures. Currently training at Vector India, Hyderabad, I‚Äôm working extensively with microcontrollers like ARM7 (LPC2129/LPC2148), 8051, and AVR (ATmega328P), and gaining in-depth knowledge of embedded hardware and software integration.

My focus areas include real-time operating systems (RTOS), Linux-based development, and communication protocols such as CAN, SPI, I2C, and UART. I enjoy problem-solving and continuously seek to improve system efficiency and reliability. My dedication to learning and building practical solutions is driven by a passion for coding, electronics, and system interfacing.

I‚Äôm looking forward to contributing to innovative embedded technology projects and growing in a challenging, fast-paced environment that values creativity and technical depth.
