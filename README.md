## Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio 

## üìåAbout Me

I am Gopal Dhanokar, an Embedded Systems trainee with strong programming skills in C, C++, Embedded C, and Data Structures. Currently training at Vector India, Hyderabad, I‚Äôm working extensively with microcontrollers like ARM7 (LPC2129/LPC2148), 8051, and AVR (ATmega328P), and gaining in-depth knowledge of embedded hardware and software integration.

My focus areas include real-time operating systems (RTOS), Linux-based development, and communication protocols such as CAN, SPI, I2C, and UART. I enjoy problem-solving and continuously seek to improve system efficiency and reliability. My dedication to learning and building practical solutions is driven by a passion for coding, electronics, and system interfacing.

I‚Äôm looking forward to contributing to innovative embedded technology projects and growing in a challenging, fast-paced environment that values creativity and technical depth.

## üóÇÔ∏è Academic Projects:
__ü§ñ 1. ALL IN ONE ROBOT__

__Objective:__ The project focuses on developing a multifunctional robotic system designed for military applications. It integrates advanced features such as line following, obstacle avoidance, IR remote control, voice control, and mobile application-based control for versatile operation. Additionally, the robot incorporates specialized systems like landmine detection, RADAR technology, unwanted activities detection, fire detection, GPS navigation, and a solar panel power supply. The goal is to create a unified platform that enhances military operations by providing surveillance, reconnaissance, and tactical support while ensuring safety and sustainability.

__Learning Keys:__
 - Gained hands-on experience in embedded systems and sensor integration (IR, ultrasonic, GPS, fire, metal detection).
 - Implemented multi-control modes: voice, IR remote, mobile app, and autonomous navigation.
 - Developed military-grade features like landmine detection, RADAR, intruder alert, and fire detection.
 - Integrated GPS for real-time navigation and tracking.
 - Utilized solar panel for sustainable power management.
 - Strengthened skills in team collaboration, embedded C programming, and real-time system design.
